## 🎯 About This Project

This project was born during my Java Swing studies at university, following an idea that came to me: **"What if we could make Swing interfaces truly modern?"**.

It's a **partial demonstration** that reproduces some visual elements of the Spotify Desktop interface, with particular focus on:
- The homepage with sidebar
- The album presentation page
- Basic audio control bar

**⚠️ This is NOT:**
- A complete Spotify application
- A functional audio player
- A professional project

## 🛠️ What's Implemented

### ✅ Included Features:
- Visual interface inspired by Spotify
- Navigation between homepage and album page
- Modern design with colors and typography
- Customized Swing components
- Basic audio playback (one demo sound only)

### ❌ **NOT Included:**
- Complete audio playback system
- Music library management
- Search and recommendations
- Spotify API connection
- Etc...
